# What I have learned

While I was building My Cellar I have learned the fundamentals of MVC architecture, and how to create a database on MongoDB. 

# Source

This project began as a todo-app created as part of the 100DDevs course curriculum (by MayanWolfe), but I have implemented numerous features and changes. 

# Refactoring

I'm not pleased with the layout yet, I know it's not working on all screen sizes. The styling in general needs improving. I might use React or Tailwind in the future, but for now the most important thing is that it works.
